# Personal_Task_Tracker

A simple task management app built with React and TypeScript. Users can:

 - Add new tasks with a text input.

- Edit or delete existing tasks.

- Mark tasks as completed, which changes their background color.

- Track the number of characters per task (max 100).

The app uses React hooks (useState) to manage state and React-Bootstrap for styling and layout.
